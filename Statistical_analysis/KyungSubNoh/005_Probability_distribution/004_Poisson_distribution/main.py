# ================================================================================
# Poisson distribution
# - Probability distribution where specific event has very low probability of occurring

# - Probability of professional horse rider falls off
# - Probability of the bus arriving when you arrive the bus station

# Use Poisson distribution for above cases

# ================================================================================
# Number of riding horse: n

# Number of falling off: x
