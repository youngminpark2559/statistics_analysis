================================================================================
* Hypothesis
* Claim or guess about the "given fact" or "fact that you want to prove"

* Given fact: drink A has 300ml

* "fact that you want to prove": drink A has really 300ml?

================================================================================
* There are guesses which are correct and incorrect

* so you have 2 hypothesises

* null hypothesis

* anti hypothesis

================================================================================
* research: estimate parameters of population via sample

* opinion on parameters: hypothesis

================================================================================
null hypothesis = zero hypothesis

null hypothesis: $$$H_0$$$

null hypothesis is the hypothesis that you don't need to research

sentence a: "drink A has 300ml"

if sentence a is correct, you don't need to perform research on it

================================================================================
anti-hypothesis: is hypothesis against "null hypothesis"

anti-hypothesis is used for research

anti-hypothesis: $$$H_1$$$

sentence b: "drink A doesn't have 300ml"

================================================================================
Test on hypothesis

set p-value $$$\alpha$$$

value from hypothesis $$$\subset$$$ $$$\alpha$$$: hypothesis is selected
value from hypothesis $$$\notin$$$ $$$\alpha$$$: hypothesis is rejected

$$$\alpha$$$, value from hypothesis, $$$\alpha$$$: two tail test
value from hypothesis, $$$\alpha$$$: one tail test

* Test "anti hypothesis" which claims "null hypothesis" is not true

* If "anti hypothesis" is correctly proved, "null hypothesis" is rejected
and "anti hypothesis" is selected

* Meaning:
if drink A has 300.1ml, 310ml, etc, you accept "null hypothesis" (drink A has 300ml)

If drink A has 200ml or 400ml, you reject "null hypothesis"

================================================================================

* Generally, customer doesn't have complain if drink A has more than 300ml
* So, in that case, you can perform "one-sided test"

* In case of drink A example, you can perform only left-one-sided test

================================================================================
Workflow for test

1. Set hypothesises
$$$H_0$$$, $$$H_1$$$

2. Set p-value

3. Set rejection area

4. Calculate statistical value

5. Decision
